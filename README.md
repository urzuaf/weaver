# Weaver

Weaver (`.wevr`) is a semantic configuration language designed to represent data with highly interconnected properties. Unlike flat formats like JSON or YAML, Weaver natively supports **dynamic references** (e.g., `url = server.host + server.port`) and **semantic units** (e.g., `timeout = 10min + 10s`), allowing you to build easy readable and understable objects. It is ideal for small- to medium-sized configuration files or general object modeling, compiling down to standard JSON for easy integration with any application.
